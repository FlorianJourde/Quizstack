                Select the topics, difficulty levels, and question types that match your goals—whether you’re reviewing
                fundamentals or preparing for a technical interview. You can combine multiple categories like HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, React, Node.js, accessibility, performance, or testing to build a focused practice set.</p>
            <p class="fade-in-up opacity-75" style="transition-delay: 0.2s;">Use difficulty filters to balance speed and
                challenge, and sort by new, most missed, or highest rated to target high-impact questions. Save your
                favorite filter presets to quickly resume where you left off on mobile or desktop. Logged-in users can
                sync preferences across devices and receive personalized recommendations based on recent activity.</p>
            <p class="fade-in-up opacity-75" style="transition-delay: 0.2s;">Set clear intentions, minimize
                distractions, and practice with purpose. The right filters turn every session into measurable
                progress.</p>
